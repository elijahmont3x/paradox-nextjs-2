const faqData = {
  general: [
    {
      q: "What exactly is $ROACH?",
      q_meme: "WTF is this $ROACH thing?",
      a: "$ROACH is a unique SPL token on the Solana blockchain featuring 'antifragile' tokenomics. It's designed to strengthen its ecosystem and reward holders, particularly during market sell-offs, by dynamically adjusting transaction taxes.",
      a_meme: "$ROACH is the token that eats FUD for breakfast and craps out rewards for HODLers. When markets bleed, it gets STRONGER. Built different.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why the cockroach theme?",
      q_meme: "Cockroaches? Really?",
      a: "Cockroaches are nature's ultimate survivors, embodying resilience and the ability to thrive under extreme pressure. This perfectly symbolizes the antifragile nature of $ROACH's tokenomics â€“ gaining strength from chaos.",
      a_meme: "Because they're UNKILLABLE LEGENDS! Survived dinosaurs, nukes... probably even your crypto portfolio. $ROACH is built like them: gets stronger when attacked.",
    },
     {
      q: "Is this just another meme coin?",
      q_meme: "Smells like a meme rug...",
      a: "While $ROACH embraces the cockroach meme for its powerful symbolism and branding, it's built on innovative, serious tokenomics designed for long-term sustainability and holder benefit. Security measures like audits and locked liquidity underpin the project.",
      a_meme: "It's a meme with an INDESTRUCTIBLE core. Funny face, serious tech. Liquidity's locked, contract's audited. Not your average pump & dump.",
    },
  ],
  mechanics: [
    {
      q: "How does the 5-tier dynamic system work?",
      q_meme: "Explain the 5-tier FUD defense levels.",
      a: "The smart contract monitors the ratio of sell volume to buy volume over rolling 4-hour periods. Based on this ratio, it automatically adjusts the token's operational 'tier', which changes the buy/sell taxes and the percentage of sell tax distributed as reflections to holders.",
      a_meme: "Contract watches the charts 24/7. Lots of selling = HIGHER TIER. Higher tier = OUCH taxes for sellers, YUMMY reflections for HODLers, and CHEAPER buys for new roaches joining the colony.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I earn reflection rewards?",
      q_meme: "How do I get free $ROACH tendies?",
      a: "Simply hold $ROACH tokens in your Solana wallet. A percentage of every sell transaction (ranging from 3% in Tier 1 up to 10% in Tier 5) is automatically redistributed proportionally to all existing holders.",
      a_meme: "Just HODL! When paper hands dump their bags, you automatically get a cut of their sell tax dropped into your wallet. The more they panic, the more you stack. EZ.",
    },
     {
      q: "How does $ROACH handle large whale dumps?",
      q_meme: "Can whales dump on us and crush the price?",
      a: "Large sell volumes trigger higher tiers (Tier 4 & 5). This significantly increases the sell tax (up to 15%) making large dumps expensive, while simultaneously maximizing reflection rewards (up to 10%) for remaining holders. This disincentivizes sudden large sell-offs and helps stabilize the ecosystem.",
      a_meme: "Let 'em try! Big dumps = INSTANT Tier 5 = MEGA taxes for the whale, MAX reflections for the Colony, and SUPER CHEAP buys for reinforcements. Their dump becomes our fuel.",
    },
  ],
  technical: [
    {
      q: "Is the smart contract audited?",
      q_meme: "Is this code safe or sketchy?",
      a: "Yes, the $ROACH smart contract has undergone a comprehensive security audit by CertiK. The audit confirmed the absence of critical or major vulnerabilities. The full audit report is publicly available.",
      a_meme: "Audited by the pros at CertiK. Passed with flying colors. Safer than Fort Knox guarded by cyber-cockroaches.",
    },
    {
      q: "What about the liquidity pool?",
      q_meme: "Is the liquidity locked or can devs run off?",
      a: "The initial liquidity provided on Raydium during the launch is locked for a minimum of 12 months using the PinkLock service, preventing removal by the team. Proof of lock is publicly verifiable.",
      a_meme: "Locked for 1 year solid. Can't be rugged. Team can't touch it. Your funds are safer than a roach in a fallout shelter.",
    },
     {
      q: "Where can I view the contract code?",
      q_meme: "Show me the code, nerd!",
      a: "The $ROACH contract address is [ROACHaBXfk3N57vr1gDmQCkSp22d9Xv4V1f] (Replace with actual). You can view the verified source code on Solana explorers like Solscan or SolanaFM.",
       a_meme: "It's all public on the blockchain, my dude. Address: [ROACHaBXfk3N57vr1gDmQCkSp22d9Xv4V1f] (Replace). Go peek, no secrets here.", // Remember to replace address
